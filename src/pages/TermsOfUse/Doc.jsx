    "Bargain Moto (also referred to as ‘the company’) is a licensed independent vehicle dealer that facilitates the buying and selling of vehicles between private vehicle owners (Original Sellers) and End Buyers, by purchasing vehicles from Original Sellers and subsequently and separately selling those vehicles to the End Buyers. ",
    "The company provides vehicle marketing services for vehicle owners and offers them the advantage of getting the most from the sale of their vehicles by eliminating middlemen price mark-ups and eliminating the cost and problems associated with selling a car, including: marketing, pre-qualifying prospective buyers, manually managing test drive logistics, processing transactions and managing transfer of ownership.",
    "Further, Bargain Moto offers End Buyers the advantage of buying at the best price possible, due to the elimination of middlemen price mark-ups, as well as quality assurances and transaction safety (achieved through our pre-sale vehicle inspection, ownership verification, financing options, limited warranties and post-sale services).",

      paragraphs: [
        "Once an End Buyer agrees to purchase a vehicle listed for sale by a Bargain Moto Original Seller, we process and hold payment from the End Buyer, purchase the vehicle from the Original Seller and then sell to the End Buyer. ",
        "Vehicle transactions are not processed directly between buyers and sellers. They are processed separately and subsequently through the Bargain Moto platform as a Bargain Moto purchase from an Original Seller, and then as a Bargain Moto sale to an End Buyer. We do this to enable us protect the interest of both parties - by ensuring that the Original Seller does not release the vehicle to the End Buyer without payment for the vehicle and that the End Buyer does not release the payment to the Original Seller before receiving the vehicle. It is also necessary for us to be able to assume responsibility for the transaction and provide the End Buyer with limited warranty on the vehicle, where applicable, and various post-sale services as we may be able to offer from time to time",
        "Bargain Moto may employ the services of third party partners in processing vehicle transactions. By using our services as an End Buyer or Original Seller, you agree to pay or receive payment through us via our payment providers, and you agree to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of our third party providers. ",
        "The services offered by Bargain Moto in no way constitute an offer to act on your behalf, whether as an Original Seller or End Buyer, as your agent or otherwise, in consummating the purchase or sale of any vehicle. ",
